# GitHub Actions Workflow is created for testing and preparing the plugin release in the following steps:
# - Validate Gradle Wrapper.
# - Run 'test' and 'verifyPlugin' tasks.
# - Run Qodana inspections.
# - Run the 'buildPlugin' task and prepare artifact for further tests.
# - Run the 'runPluginVerifier' task.
# - Create a draft release.
#
# The workflow is triggered on push and pull_request events.
